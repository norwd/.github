# Security Policy

This is my [general security policy]. Each project may or may not have its own
version or specific details, so be sure to also check if the project has a file
at `.github/SECURITY.md`.

## Supported Versions

As long as I am actively maintaining a project, all versions are "supported", or
at least, I'll do my best to provide as much help as a solo developer can offer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report a [security advisory] if you find any security issues or
vulnerabilities.
