# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

If you'd like to contribute, please open a PR. Be sure to explain what your
proposed changes do. If you're unsure about something, or don't know how to make
a change that you'd like to see, open an issue and I'll see what I can do ðŸ™‚

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This repository enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin ([DCO]) on Pull
Requests. All commit messages must contain the [`Signed-off-by`] line with an
email address that matches the commit author. The DCO is a lightweight way to
certify that you wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code you are
contributing to this project.

## AI Generated Code

Code generated from large language models must be disclosed as such. As any code
produced from an AI is essentially taken from publicly accessible code, there is
no way to verify that the code has been certified under the DCO. Even the person
who prompted the AI could not certify the code produced.

With this in mind, AI generated contributions will be accepted *only* if:

1. The data-set contains only code that can be traced back to indivdual authors
2. *AND* those authors consented to their code being included in the data-set
3. *AND* their code was published under a compatible open source license
